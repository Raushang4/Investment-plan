                            <p>The Advisor obtains information from a wide variety of publicly available sources and some private sources as well.

                            <p>Please be fully informed regarding the risks and costs associated with trading the financial markets, as it is one of the riskiest investment forms possible.</p>
                            <p>Equity Cash/Futures/Options/Commodity trading on margin involves high risk and is not suitable for all investors.</p>

                            <p>Any controversy arising out or relating to any transaction or the construction, performance, or breach of this or any other agreement between the parties shall be settled by arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
